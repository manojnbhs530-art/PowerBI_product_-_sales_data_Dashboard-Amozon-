Amazon Product Sales Dashboard – 
Project Overview

This project analyzes Amazon product sales data using Power BI. The objective was to transform raw e-commerce data into an interactive dashboard that provides insights into revenue, customer feedback, product performance, and regional sales. By utilizing Power BI’s visualization and modeling capabilities, the dashboard presents a clear and structured view of Amazon’s sales from 2023 to 2025.

Dashboard Highlights

The dashboard includes key performance indicators such as Total Revenue (3.33M), Products Sold (269), Positive Reviews (61), Negative Reviews (96), and Average Ratings (2.93). These measures give a quick overview of overall business performance.

Revenue by month highlights trends and fluctuations throughout the years. Ratings by category provide insight into customer satisfaction across Fashion, Beauty, Electronics, Sports, Books, and Home & Kitchen. Regional analysis covers both revenue and products sold in markets such as the USA, UK, India, Germany, Canada, and Australia, helping to identify strong and weak-performing regions.

Key Insights

The analysis shows that categories like Electronics and Fashion perform strongly, while Books and Sports receive relatively lower ratings. The majority of sales are concentrated in regions such as the USA, UK, and Australia. The average customer rating of 2.93 indicates the need for improvements in product quality or service.

Tools and Techniques

This project was developed in Power BI Desktop. Data cleaning and transformation were carried out using Power Query, followed by the creation of data models to support the visuals. Charts, KPIs, and filters were integrated into a single dashboard to provide both high-level and detailed views of business performance.

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how Power BI can be applied in business intelligence and data analytics. By combining sales data, customer reviews, and regional performance, the dashboard supports better decision-making and performance tracking. It also showcases practical skills in data modeling, visualization, and dashboard design.
